-- join by album so that there is no Name with 0 Albums, group by name and sort by total descending order.alter.

	totalalbums DESC;


-- 2. Show name and address of customer with highest total sales across the complete invoice table.

-- Same as in the previous exercise but now instead of selecting just the name, now we concatenate the first and last name.

	customer.Address,
    SUM(invoice.Total) AS Total
FROM 
	customer
LEFT JOIN

-- i.e., a track is number 1 if it is present in maximum number of playlists.

-- -- Same as in the previous exercise but now we only want the first 10 rows so we change the limit function from 1 to 10.

SELECT
	track.name,
    COUNT(playlisttrack.PlaylistId) AS most_popular
FROM 
	track
RIGHT JOIN 
	playlisttrack ON track.TrackId = playlisttrack.PlaylistId
